# guessing-game

### Description

- The project guessing game is a simple user-input based program.

- It takes the user's number and, after parsing it, compares it to the number generated by the computer. 
  The initial variable var continueWithNewGame is set to true and as long as it has this value the game runs.

- The computer generates a random number and logs it in the console.
  The userGuessedCorrectly variable is initialised and set to false. As long as its value is false another while loop executes.

- The inner while loop contains the variable userGuessString. It gets the number from the user's input, the value is parsed to an integer and passed to the userGuess     variable.

- The value of userGuess is compared against computerGuess and if they match the console logs the information "You've guessed the number" otherwise it logs "Try again".

- At the end of the program anotherGameAnswer variable, which holds the string: "Do you want to play another game? Y/N   ", is introduced and if the user inputs N, the initial variable, set at the beginning of the program : continueWithTheGame, is set to false which terminates the main while loop and the console logs a Goodbye message.
